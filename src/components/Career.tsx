              I worked as a Frontend Developer Intern at MK Soft Service for
              three months. During this internship, I worked on frontend web
              design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I built a complete company
              website that shared important information about the organization,
              including its services, production work, and overall activities.
              The website included different sections such as About Us,
              Services, Contact, and a photo gallery. This project helped me
              improve my skills in creating clean, well-structured, responsive,
              and userfriendly web pages.
